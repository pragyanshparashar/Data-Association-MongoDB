# Data Association MongoDB App

A full-stack web application demonstrating user authentication, relational data modeling, and protected routes using MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and EJS.  
This project showcases real-world backend architecture patterns such as JWT authentication, hashed passwords, middleware authorization, and schema relationships.

---

## 🚀 Features

- User Registration & Login system
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Protected routes with middleware
- Create posts
- Like / Unlike posts
- Edit posts
- User ↔ Post relationship (MongoDB references)
- Server-side rendering using EJS
- Session persistence using cookies

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express.js

**Database**
- MongoDB
- Mongoose ODM

**Authentication**
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- bcrypt password hashing
- cookie-parser

**Frontend**
- EJS templating engine
- TailwindCSS (CDN)

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

This application follows a classic MVC-inspired backend pattern:

Client → Routes → Middleware → Controller Logic → Database → View Rendering.


Relationships implemented:

User
└── posts → references Post collection

Post
└── user → references User collection
└── likes → array of User references


---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers
2. Password is hashed
3. JWT token is generated
4. Token stored in cookies
5. Protected routes verify token
6. If valid → access granted
7. If invalid → redirect to login
